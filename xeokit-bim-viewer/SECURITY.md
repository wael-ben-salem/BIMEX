# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly and privately. Do not disclose it as a public issue. This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

You may submit the report in the following ways:

üìß Send an email to [support@creoox.com](mailto:support@creoox.com).

‚ÑπÔ∏è Please provide the following information in your report:
- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- How to reproduce the issue.
- We will try our best within reasonable efforts to get back to you as soon as possible.

Alternatively, you can also use a more direct way through our [Service Desk](https://creoox.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals) to create a ticket.

Thank you for your cooperation and contribution!
